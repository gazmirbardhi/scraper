## Recipe for Cinnamon Toast Crunch Peach Cobbler

### Ingredients:

* 2 cans of sliced peaches in syrup
* 1 cup of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, crushed
* 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup of granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup of unsalted butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt
* 1/2 cup of milk

### Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Drain the syrup from the cans of sliced peaches and place the peaches in a 9×13 inch baking dish.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the crushed Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, ground cinnamon, and salt.
4. Pour the melted butter and milk into the mixing bowl and stir until a crumbly mixture forms.
5. Spread the crumble mixture evenly over the peaches in the baking dish.
6. Bake the dessert for 40-45 minutes, or until the crumble topping is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling.
7. Let the dessert cool for a few minutes before serving. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

### Tips:

* Use a food processor or blender to crush the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal into fine crumbs.
* If you prefer a thicker crumble topping, add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to the mixture.
* For a richer flavor, substitute half of the milk with heavy cream.
* Make sure the melted butter is cooled down before adding it to the dry ingredients to avoid cooking the eggs in the mixture.
